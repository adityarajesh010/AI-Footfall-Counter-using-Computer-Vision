# Footfall Counter Frontend

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Upload a video for Market Square, Grocery Store, or Subway.
3. The result (count) will be displayed below each form.

## Note
- The frontend expects the FastAPI backend to be running and accessible at the same host/port.
- You may need to serve the frontend using a simple HTTP server (e.g., Python's `http.server`) if you want AJAX to work locally.
